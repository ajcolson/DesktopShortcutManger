# DesktopShortcutManger
An app to quickly manage shortcuts from the desktop on Windows. You can download a copy of the app on the [Releases](https://github.com/ajcolson/DesktopShortcutManger/releases) page.

# Can't I already delete desktop shortcuts without an app?
Yes, yes you probably can. This app was written to cover a verify specific use case:
> Users that are not administrators on their computer, but want to delete shortcuts found in the "Public Desktop" directory.

This was written to be deployed in an enterprise enviroment where some apps can be whitelisted to run with elevated permissions to allow users to remove unwanted shortcuts without calling a network admin to authorize and login to their computer to complete.
This app probably won't be useful outside of this context.
